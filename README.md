Task 11
Write a complete Python script for Google Colab that performs morphological operations on an uploaded image. The script should allow the user to interactively upload a grayscale or binary image, convert it to binary if necessary, and apply basic morphological operations including erosion, dilation, opening, closing, as well as boundary extraction, hole filling using morphological reconstruction, and noise removal. It should also perform shape detection by finding contours, approximating polygonal curves, classifying shapes as triangles, rectangles, or circles, and labeling them on the image. Finally, the script should display all results — original binary image, erosion, dilation, opening, closing, boundary, hole filled, noise removed, and shape detection — in a single figure with multiple subplots using matplotlib.
